# Object-tracking-with-Detectron2
This project was to built a simple object tracker using a Detectron2 pre-trained model. We first performed an instance segmentation task on a set of frames of a video in order to obtain the predictions. Then, we implemented an algorithm to link these predictions over time to perform an object tracking task.
